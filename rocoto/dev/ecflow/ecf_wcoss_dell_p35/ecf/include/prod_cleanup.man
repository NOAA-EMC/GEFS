Notes:

If the envir of this job is "prod", only the prod com/nwges directories are cleaned up.
If the envir of this job is "para", para and test com/nwges directories are cleaned up.
If the envir of this job is "test", a "dry-run" of prod clean up is performed, printing
changes that would be made if the envir were prod.

The following variables may be set to ON or OFF to override the above settings:
             cleanup_com_prod        thin_com_prod
             cleanup_com_para        thin_com_para
             cleanup_com_test        thin_com_test
             cleanup_com_transfer    thin_nwges
             cleanup_com_dev         thin_tmpnwprd
             cleanup_nwges_prod  
             cleanup_nwges_para
             cleanup_nwges_test

--------------------------------------- COM ---------------------------------------
COM directories are cleaned up according to the cleanup_rm_com parm file, NWGES
directories according to the cleanup_rm_nwges directories, and thins COM files
according to any cleanup_thin_*.list files in the prod_filemanager parm directory.

Dated directories with the format ${COMROOT}/${NET}/${envir}/${RUN}.2#######* are
cleaned up.  Therefore, to prevent a directory from being cleaned, one should ensure
that the digit following the period is not a "2".  For example
/com/model/test/domain.20180629.save WILL be cleaned but /com/model/test/domain.S20180629
will NOT.

Within the cleanup_rm_com parm file, the COMROOT can be set to one of the following for
each $NET/$RUN combination:
    ALL      - Clean up the directory on all phases:
    com_p1   - WCOSS Phase 1 (/gpfs/?p1/nco/ops/com)
    com_p2   - WCOSS Phase 2 (/gpfs/?p2/nco/ops/com)
    comhps   - Cray XC40 disk (/gpfs/hps/nco/ops/com)
    comhps2  - Cray XC40 disk (/gpfs/hps2/nco/ops/com)
    comhps3  - Cray XC40 disk (/gpfs/hps3/nco/ops/com)
    comdell1 - WCOSS Phase 3 (/gpfs/dell1/nco/ops/com)
    comdell2 - WCOSS Phase 3 (/gpfs/dell1/nco/ops/com)
    comdell3 - WCOSS Phase 3 (/gpfs/dell1/nco/ops/com)
    compath  - Use the compath.py utility to determine the COMROOT. All
               envir's (prod, para, test,...) will use the same root.
To disable a cleanup, leave the corresponding space under "DIRECTORY DAYS TO KEEP" blank.
Note that the present day is included in the DAYS TO KEEP number, so to keep 10 previous
days, you would enter 11 (1 current day + 10 previous days).

The thinning process is based on a set of files very similar in format to the transfer
list files:
    ${PARMprod_filemanager}/cleanup_thin_${model}.list
To add a new thinning process, simply drop a file with a name of the form
cleanup_thin_${model}.list into the parm directory.  If one wishes to thin directories
on multiple phases, each directory location must be placed in the file on a separate line.
As in the transfer parm files, one may use compath.py to resolve the directory path
by beginning the path in the parm file  with "com/" (no leading slash).  Unfortunately,
the script that performs the thinning process does not support compath.py for para and
test data, so if the envir of this job is "para", thinning will not occur unless an
absolute path is used in the parm file.

--------------------------------------- PCOM ---------------------------------------
Files older than 90 days (mtime) are cleaned up in the following pcom directories:
   /pcom
   /pcom2
   /gpfs/hps/nco/ops/pcom
Directories are not included, so empty directories will be left behind until they
are manually cleaned up.
The prod job cleans up all of pcom - when run with envir=para, pcom is not cleaned up.

-------------------------------- WORKING DIRECTORIES -------------------------------
tmpnwprd directories are cleaned in all spaces (files older than 24 hours old according
to ctime), including /tmpnwprd, /tmpnwprd1, /tmpnwprd2, /tmpnwprd_p2, /tmpnwprd_d3, and
tmpnwprd in hps, hps2, hps3, dell1, dell1, and dell3.
